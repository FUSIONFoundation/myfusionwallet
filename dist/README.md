The Fusion wallet is the central place for users to execute P-FSN token transfers, time-lock assets for loaning, swap assets using quantum swap, buy tickets for staking and more.

For the purpose of PSN, Fusion adapted the My Ether Wallet (MEW) interface, a trusted, open-source wallet as the basis for the Fusion Wallet. The wallet selection was based on MEW’s open-source code, security parameters, and reputation. By amending the original code, Fusion satisfied the requirements for PSN usability while maintaining a high level of security. The Fusion Wallet parallels MEW in security, common functionalities, plus look and feel. The purpose of using a trusted and familiar wallet like MEW is to give users the confidence that their digital assets are secure and limit the learning curve with a familiar interface.

For technically inclined community members, the open-source code will be made available. Users can dive into the Fusion Wallet code and explore the ingenious ways Fusion adapted MEW’s source code including the extra functionality: time-lock, quantum swap, staking, and more.
